Todo:
- adjust SuggestionBuilder for new code
- add tts for suggestions
- calculate the angles for other joints like the wrist, ankle


Someday:
- refactor the code to remove redundant frozen sets, redudant dimension for the joint_angle_calculator's calculate_joint_angles()'s numpy array
- add an try except block to capture that annoying exception that occurs when the person \
    moves out of the frame
- stop displaying the head too
- [ ] Pose classification based on angles
- [ ] (multiple camera capturing) mapping the keypoints based on multiple pictures from different angles
